# Simple Reddit Web App

Don't get confuse with the name of the project. It's just a simple app in which a user can create a post with some public and private information. But in order to create this post, a user must has an account. A user can create his account by his mobile no. and email address.

Public information is visible to anyone, even though if there is no user logged in. But to see the private information user has to be logged in and that information will not be displayed on the website, instead the private information will be sent him to his email address.
